Mathematics seeks truth. Mathematics seeks also to communicate truth. In fact, A successful research mathematician is one who can derive new truths and share them effectively and unambiguously with others. Unfortunately, spoken language becomes a barrier to effective communication in two cases. The first, when the spoken languages of two individuals is different. While certain truths may be understandable from pcitures and a silent geometric proof, many of math's most beautiful proofs require some level of verbal communication. The second is that language is easy to misconstrue or, ever worse, one believes they understand the meaning of something while certain terms have differing connotations between people. (maybe give an example in English)

NOTE: I went in some direction with this, who knows what, I'm gonna restart below and not try to be so verbose

"Every dog likes fetch." A disgustingly false claim. "You know what I mean." Say what you mean, not rash generalizations. "Shut up, Elan." Fucking make me. -- Nah restart but fun lead in

I need a better smooth way to intro:
Many mathematical tatements begin with one of the two following starts.


1) "Every *blank* is *blank*."
2) "There exists a *blank* which is *blank*."

Pick better things that those blanks






## Logical Quantifiers

- What is exists? For all? Dual notions
- How to express a size of a set (d-Sigma)

## Ulm Sequences

- Sequences of numbers associated with groups (I can tell any groups apart by their corresponding, let's call it Ulm seq)
- How hard is it to say a certain thing in the sequence is saying it in terms of d-$\Sigma$


### New Try of Quantifiers

Mathematics can help you answer a lot of questions, but it cannot help you with everything. Sad, but the unfortunate truth of our highly complicated world. In order to understand what it can help us answer, we have to be formal with our definition of a question. Mathematical logic prefers that you ask your questions in one of two forms:

1) Is every *blank* is *blank*?
2) Does there exist a *blank* which is *blank*?

Funnily enough, these questions are more related than you may think. If you ask me a question of the first form, and it is true, then there is some question of the second form which is false. Is every *fork* a *utensil*? Yes. Does there exist a *fork* which is a *non-utensil*? Similarly, for any question of the first form that is false, there is some question of the second form which is true. Is every *dog* a *pilot*? No. Does there exist a *dog* which is *a non-pilot*? Notice how the notion of negation appears. IDk where I'm going im gonna go get dinner
